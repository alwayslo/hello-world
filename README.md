# hello-world
first repository (demo)

My name is Lo and I am just starting in the world of 'coding'. I've used two primary development environments: MATlab and R. I've begun messing with commands using bash and terminal for my mac. My husband is much much more proficient in all these things including Swift, C, C++, etc. He's the patient one who helps me trouble shoot.
